# Sharaf - a fragrance e-commerce website

This is our web development course project where we need to develop a website focusing on client-side scripting using vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW BEFORE RUNNING

1. Basically, all page is link to one another, no placeholder and etc (can directly open from any page).
2. Product data is stored in JSON file and are fetch and display during page load.
3. Searching functionaly only works on catalog page.
4. For authentication, need to sign up first since account is stored in localStorage.
5. We implement JQuery UI on function showPopup (with slide-in animation) on both login and cart page.
6. Can use promo code "webtech" to get 40% OFF when checking out! YAY

## Run Locally

### Pre-requisite (can skip to step no. 2 if you have already installed Git and Node.js.)
1. On Windows, open Terminal

```bash
  winget install node.js
  winget install git.git
```

### If already have Git and Node.js
2. Clone the project

  git clone https://github.com/pembasmikuman/Sharaf.git
```

3. Go to the project directory

6. Then, install Live Server Extension inside VS Code (if not yet).
