## THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW BEFORE RUNNING

1. Basically, all page is link to one another, no placeholder and etc.
2. searching only works on catalog page.

## Run Locally

1. On Windows, open Terminal

```bash
  winget install node.js
  winget install git.git
```

### If already have Git and Node.js
2. Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/pembasmikuman/Sharaf.git
```

3. Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd Sharaf
```

4. Start the server

  code '.\Sharaf'
```

6. Then, install Live Server Extension inside VS Code (if not yet).
