In the middle notes, a rich fusion of aromatic spices and softwoods give depth and character, thus, scent imbibed with a sophisticated warmth. As for the base notes, they leave a profound hint mixed with earthly vetiver, strong mosslike oak, and small cloud of a friendly amber, which is the final tone that acidifies strength and integrity.",
