In the middle notes, a rich fusion of aromatic spices and softwoods give depth and character, thus, scent imbibed with a sophisticated warmth. As for the base notes, they leave a profound hint mixed with earthly vetiver, strong mosslike oak, and small cloud of a friendly amber, which is the final tone that acidifies strength and integrity.",

Adding to this are heart notes of Java vetiver oil, clary sage and rum, which lend a smoky, herbal ambience to the formula that imitates the dark rooms of the club itself. Finally, base notes of styrax, vanilla bean and tobacco leaf leave a creamy rich foundation that's sure to settle into your skin for hours after last call.",

The perfumer’s mastered craft and the wisdom gained with time gave birth to this woody extrait de perfume, an ultimate accomplishment for Francis Kurkdjian. The Grandiflorum jasmine head note gently underscores the craftsman’s voice. The hint of fire is enhanced with powdered epicurean facets of bitter almond. Lastly, the mineral note built around ambergris is tamed with an ambery and woody accord. Adding to the intensity of the extrait, the perfume bottle also plays with light. Its aesthetic dons a brilliant red robe reminiscent of Baccarat red. Baccarat Rouge 540 Maison Francis Kurkdjian extrait de parfum embodies the profusion and fusion of elements that can only be tamed by the art of the perfumer and the wisdom gained with time.",
